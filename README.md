# SQL-Challenge
### Completed 8-16-23
#### The exercises in this challenge where completed in partnership with David Pinsky.

## DATA MODELING
- The attached .png is a diagram of the tables used in this challenge and their corresponding PK and FK connections. Composite Keys were used where applicable.

## DATA ENGINEERING
- The Schema for this challenge were exported from the diagraming tool found at https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com. This schema export included several lines of ALTER TABLE queries at the end that ultimately did not serve the purposes of the assignemnt and were therefore unsued but commented out to preserve the heart of the export.

## DATA ANALYSIS 
- Each point in the assignment was labled in the code as Task #1-8 and built in partnership with David Pinsky. Similarities are expected between our submissions.
- For extra pizaz, many of the columns selected throughout the tasks were aliased to enhance readability of the query results.
